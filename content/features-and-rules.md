### Goals

Jamfest EQ goal is to collect feedback for projects like ProjectEQ and EQEmu. This is done with the `#issue <msg>` command, which you are encouraged to use at every opportunity you find something you believe is odd. Try to avoid duplicate issues, but don't worry about coordinating with others. Volunteers are assisting behind the scenes with triaging issues. Don't expect any of them to immediately be repaired, and if you do find something that is game breaking, please report it to a GM in game.

Jamfest is currently in alpha, and our goal is, instead of changing Jamfest's content db, we change PEQ's db, and trickle it back to jamfest, this means changes we do affect all future servers who base on PEQ.

We also want to discover and attempt to capture expansions not currently handled by the PEQ team, which currently only goes to Dragons of Norrath.

Due to the sheer volume of content missing in future expansions, we are going to looking at ways on how we can capture the "essence" of future expansions, putting together a "lite edition", that gives players goals and achievements, and adjusting content that is too trivial or too difficult for the expansion's entry.

### Features

Many features are intentionally opt in. This is so players can jam in Jamfest EQ the way they want to. The following are some of the features you can opt in to:

- Opt in to an experience boost of 4x at creation
- Opt in to different "play modes", such as solo, group, or vanilla. Based on your mode, which is per character, scripts will affect damage incoming and outgoing, as well as healing, to help trivialize up to raid content
- Opt in to 4x loot drop rate
- Opt in to autogrant AAs for past expansions
- Opt in to a "catch up" exp boost, as further expansions release, that increases AA and exp even faster, allowing your friends and alts to catch up to the latest content

Many more features will be added as we go, and we are always open to suggestions via #issue

### Rules

In general, Jamfest is a relaxed server. We want you to have fun and enjoy the game. However, there are a few rules to keep in mind:

- MQ2 is allowed without active hacks such as warp, instacamp, etc.
- Boxing is not directly prohibited but discouraged. Play with your friends, or try out jamfest solo. We'll cater content to be trivialized by a small group of players.
- Be kind to others. No racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. No harassment. No spamming. No exploiting. No botting. No cheating. No griefing. No drama. No politics. No religion. No hate speech. No trolling. No scamming. No begging. No stealing. No killing players. No training. Be nice, please.
