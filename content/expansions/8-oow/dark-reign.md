# Dark Reign (Evil) DoN Progression

## Faction grind to indifferent
- For Solo Tasks:
  – Faction is received instantly once you kill or loot the last item needed. Reward is given on an individual basis.
  – You can only pick up 1 task at a time so you’ll need to run back and forth between completing tasks.
  – You are not able to request these specific tasks once you hit Indifferent faction.
  – Recommended Solo Tasks:
    – Blood Money
    – Spider's Web
    – Meat for Stew
    – Taunting the Brood
- For Group Missions:
  – You can request these starting at Apprehensive. Everyone in the group will receive  1x Dark Reign Token, which can be given to Xeib Darkskies (Dark Reign Mechant) in the Dark Reign Camp in the tunnels to receive faction. These are LORE, so make sure you turn them in before doing another mission!!
  – It requires a minimum of 3 players to request a group mission (mercenaries count!). There is a limit on how big the group level range can be (maybe +/- 15? This is a guess).
  – You’ll also receive  Ebon Crystals for completing Group Missions. These are used as currency at Xeib Darkskies (Dark Reign Mechant). They can be found on the top right of your main Inventory Window.
  – Recommended Group Tasks:
    – Grounding the Drakes
      - Issue #129 - "Drake Fangs" not currently dropping. Same graphic item, "Drake Claw", drops but doesn't count
    – Lavaspinner's Locals

Both options are pretty easy. If you are doing faction on 3+ characters at once you’re probably better off with the group missions. If you are doing faction on only 1 or 2 players you’ll want to consider the solo tasks. Remember  Ebon Crystals is an added bonus for doing the Group Missions.

Once you are Indifferent faction you can move onto Tier 1.


# Tier 1:
## Step 1
- Speak to Commander Zaerr Ty`Dar in Lavstorm Mountains.
  – “Hail” him
  – Say “help” to receive a character flag.

## Step 2
- In the Dark Reign Camp, Hail Officer Sirrikis Ryktor, who is standing next to Commander Zaerr Ty`Dar. You’ll receive 3 tasks upon hail. Complete all 3 of these tasks.
  - The Burning Poison
  - Blood of the Basilisk
  - Clearing the Path

Task 1: The Burning Poison
- Go to Lavaspinner’s Lair. Kill spiders and loot 5x Caustic Lavaspinner Venom. Common Drop. Spiders generally spawn in the southeast. The quest will auto-complete once you loot your 5th. Level 50-60 mobs.

Task 2: Blood of the Basilisk

Task 3: Clearing the Path
- Go to Stillmoon Temple and kill 8x a stillmoon drake (Any other drake type will NOT update the quest).  I only saw 6 up initially when I zoned in and had to wait for respawns. It appears other drake-types can be a PH for a stillmon drake. I recommend a tracker. The quest will auto-complete once you kill your 8th. Level 50-60 mobs. Zone respawn is approx. 16 minutes.

## Step 3
