# Norrath's Keeper (Good) DoN Progression

## Faction grind to indifferent
- For Solo Tasks:
  – Faction is received instantly once you kill or loot the last item needed. Reward is given on an individual basis.
  – You can only pick up 1 task at a time so you’ll need to run back and forth between completing tasks.
  – You are not able to request these specific tasks once you hit Indifferent faction.
  – Recommended Solo Tasks:
    – Blood Money
    – Spider's Web
    – Meat for Stew
    – Taunting the Brood
- For Group Missions
  - You can request these starting at Apprehensive. Everyone in the group will receive   1x Norrath’s Keepers Token, which can be given to Tatsujiro the Serene (Norrath’s Keepers Merchant) in the Norrath’s Keepers Camp in the tunnels to receive faction. These are LORE, so make sure you turn them in before doing another mission!!
  - It requires a minimum of 3 players to request a group mission (mercenaries count!). There is a limit on how big the group level range can be (maybe +/- 15? This is a guess).
- You’ll also receive  Radiant Crystals for completing Group Missions. These are used as currency at Tatsujiro the Serene (Norrath’s Keepers Merchant). They can be found on the top right of your main Inventory Window.
  – Recommended Group Tasks:
    – Grounding the Drakes
      - Issue #129 - "Drake Fangs" not currently dropping. Same graphic item, "Drake Claw", drops but doesn't count
    – Lavaspinner's Locals

Both options are pretty easy. If you are doing faction on 3+ characters at once you’re probably better off with the group missions. If you are doing faction on only 1 or 2 players you’ll want to consider the solo tasks. Remember  Radiant Crystals is an added bonus for doing the Group Missions.

Once you are Indifferent faction you can move onto Tier 1.
