You must be really cool!\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS # DOWNLOAD THJ CLIENT HERE To start The Heroes Journey (THJ):\nYou will first need an EQ Emulator account\nOnce that is complete, create a login server account\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, download the THJpatcher.zip (you may need to click on the file and tell Windows it is safe by clicking the arrow on the download and selecting \u0026ldquo;Keep\u0026rdquo;)\nRight click the zipped download, go to properties, and check Unblock in the lower right. Then click OK. Then extract the files to wherever you want EQ to be installed. Do not run the patcher in the same folder as another PEQ server install unless you are done playing on that server.\nAfter extraction, find and run heroesjourneyeq.exe. This is the file you will run to patch and play.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Patch\u0026rdquo; if it is Red (THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME)\nClick \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo; once the patch has finished or if patch is Grey (it will say Complete! Press Play to begin).\nGETTING STARTED / FIRST STEPS # Remember, you were invited to help test the early alpha version of the server. Please use the bug report discord channel to report any bugs that you encounter!\nThis is a Multiclass server. After you choose your initial class during character creation, you need to find a GM for the corresponding second and third classes. Use your \u0026ldquo;Bazaar Portal\u0026rdquo; AA, and all of the classes have a GM on the Northwest side of the zone.\nAfter your three classes have been determined and assigned, go to the\u0026quot;Fading Memory\u0026quot; in the bazaar, and hand in your \u0026ldquo;Faded Writ\u0026rdquo;. This will result in a weapon and piece of armor for each of your classes, as well as bags, and a Summoner\u0026rsquo;s SynchroSatchel. The Summoner\u0026rsquo;s SynchroSatchel can be put in your bank, and your pet will still utilize it.\nThe Summoner\u0026rsquo;s SynchroSatchel will work like your pet\u0026rsquo;s inventory. Anything you put in there will be utilized by your pet (Armor/Weapons). In can also be stored in the bank instead of on your character\nTearel will be able to port you to fast travel points you have identified. Usually this will only consist of major towns you have been to, during character creation. At early levels, it\u0026rsquo;s free!\nThe \u0026ldquo;Bazaar Portal\u0026rdquo; when used will return you to the bazaar. Make sure to put this on your hotbar right away. When you zone out of the bazaar, it will return you to wherever you were when you casted it. Some situations exist where this is not the case (Druid/Wizard Ports and Tearel). If you end up in the bazaar with no valid return destination, you will port to your bind point instead.\nOnce you selected your classes, get out there and kill some monsters!\nFAQ # [!question] Can I reroll my classes if I dont like them?\nNot right now. Eventually rerolling for EoM might be a thing, but currently it is not.\n[!question] Some of my skills arent trainable, but still show up in the GM list with no level restriction?\nOne of two things is happening. You are at the wrong GM (It needs to be the GM for the class that owns the skill) or its dual wield, and that is being worked on. Dual wield will not work until the intended level, even if you can equip more than one weapon.\n[!question] I have X problem, and I need Cata/Aporia to look at it?\nDo not ping them unless its game breaking, submit a bug-report in the discord.\n[!question] Why cant I find items that dropped on Retribution or Pyrelight dropping at the same %?\nThe loot tables are based off of Project EQ right now, not specific to either of the other servers.\n[!question] How long will this test last? Will there be a wipe?\nThis test will continue for an unknown period of time, with an increasing number of invites going out, culminating in open testing. When it is ready, there will be a full character wipe prior to going public.\n[!question] Will there be anymore wipes during the Alpha/Beta developement?\nYes, there will be a wipe before open beta, and another wipe before \u0026ldquo;Official Launch\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/new-players/","tags":null,"title":"Getting Started"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Caput vino delphine in tamen vias # Cognita laeva illo fracta # Lorem markdownum pavent auras, surgit nunc cingentibus libet Laomedonque que est.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you\u0026rsquo;d like to get.\nThe majority of configuration can be found under config.yaml. An example, with descriptions for each setting, can be found here.\nCode Block Titles # To add code block titles with Amethyst:\nEnsure that code block titles are enabled in the configuration:\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true Add the title attribute to the desired code block fence:\n```yaml {title=\u0026#34;data/config.yaml\u0026#34;} enableCodeBlockTitle: true # example from step 1 ``` Note that if {title=\u0026lt;my-title\u0026gt;} is included, and code block titles are not enabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\nHTML Favicons # If you would like to customize the favicons, you can add them to the data/config.yaml file. The default without any set favicon key is:\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;shortcut icon\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;icon.png\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;image/png\u0026#34;\u0026gt; The default can be overridden by defining a value to the favicon key in your data/config.yaml file. For example, here is a List[Dictionary] example format, which is equivalent to the default:\nfavicon: - { rel: \u0026#34;shortcut icon\u0026#34;, href: \u0026#34;icon.png\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;image/png\u0026#34; } # - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add In this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it may be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the Apple touch icon to Amethyst\u0026rsquo;s default favicon:\nfavicon: | \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;shortcut icon\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;icon.png\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;image/png\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;apple-touch-icon\u0026#34; sizes=\u0026#34;180x180\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;/apple-touch-icon.png\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your webpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more information about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read this article.\nNote that all generated favicon paths, defined by the href attribute, are relative to the static/ directory.\nGraph View # To customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around data/graphConfig.yaml. The default configuration, with descriptions, can be found here.\nLanguage Support # Chinese, Japanese, and Korean support comes out of the box with Amethyst.\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Amethyst) supports this natively.\nFollow the steps Hugo provides here and modify your config.yaml\nFor example:\ndefaultContentLanguage: ar languages: ar: languagedirection: rtl title: ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä weight: 2 Custom Styles # Want to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling in assets/_custom.scss. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in /layouts/partials.\nChanging the Color Scheme # The default color schemes for light mode and dark mode are located in assets/_colors.scss. You can replace the values for existing color variables for drop-in edits, or create new variables to reference in _custom.scss.\nChanging the Fonts # All fonts are defined in assets/_fonts.scss. There are examples for both local fonts (defined using @font-face) and webfonts (fetched with @import from a font distributor such as Google Fonts).\nYou can place all local fonts in the static/fonts folder.\nPartials # Partials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in /layouts.\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through /layouts/index.html. To customize the footer, you can edit /layouts/partials/footer.html\nMore info about partials on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s website.\nStill having problems?

Avoid central areas with significantly higher level beholders. Muddites and minotaurs tend to be easier, while beholders are a lot harder (they have an enchanter pet and can nuke hard if you can\u0026rsquo;t interrupt). Use the walls to navigate the zone without picking up lots of agro. 16-21 Gorge of King Xorbb Near the East Karana zone line a Chasm Minotaur, a Gorge Minotaur, a Muddite Minor, a Muddite Elder 100% cla Pull from the three canyons, starting with the East, then North, then West. Avoid the beholders (they\u0026rsquo;re much more powerful), which tend to come from East tunnel. One minotaur can spawn in the space between the canyons, so pull to the hill slightly farther back to avoid having him spawn on you. If you avoid killing Goblins you could eventually get enough faction with them to be able to use their bank in Runnyeye (but it will take lots of killing here) 16-17 - Erud\u0026rsquo;s Crossing Whole island Kerrans ? cla Lowers Kerra Isle faction 16-19 15-19 Lavastorm Mountains Near zone-in from Nektulos Forest or Najena a fire elemental, a lava crawler, a lava basilisk, a Rock Dervish, etc. 100% cla Pull to zone-in area to avoid adds; With the exception of a fire elemental and a fire imp most mobs are not threatening to attack. 16-18 - Toxxulia Forest On the way to Paineel Pixies 100% cla Pixies are non-social 16-20 14-18 The Overthere Mudhole (Semi Dry Lake) Cockatrices, Succulents, Sabre-toothed Tigers, etc. 100% kunark From boat keep water on your left until you get to the hills, then go right to the Mudhole.

Heavily camped, some guards have up to 24min respawn timers. 17-21 - Western Plains of Karana Field at #10 Scarecrows 100% cla Scarecrows don\u0026rsquo;t run and are undead, so you can use Sense the Dead to find the closest one. They don\u0026rsquo;t agro, can very rarely proc \u0026ldquo;fear\u0026rdquo; (stun), and they sometimes drop Sack of Hay for the nearby Gathering Grain quest (which gives an extra 1% XP or less). Watch out for werewolves and (during the era when they appear) swarmlings and The Swarm Mother, as they path through the field periodically . 17-21 - Dagnor\u0026rsquo;s Cauldron NE corner Sandbar Serpents 100% cla In the NE corner of the zone, three serpents on 2:00 timers spawn as placeholders for Jetsam, Flotsam, and Squallslither within sight of each other. This may be the fastest spawning camp in the game ‚Äî these mobs will respawn as fast as you can kill them for theoretically zero downtime. Occasionally, Barnacle Bones or a PH will wander through. 18-22 17-22 Rathe Mountains #3 a kodiak bear 100% cla Avoid the Unkempt Preservers when pulling (they will attack you if you attack the bears); if you have a spell like Harmony you can also kill Blinde the Cutpurse in nearby area #6 18-25 17-24 Lake Rathetear Aviak islands Aviak guards 100% cla Aviaks are faction-less, but social. There are seven aviak guards total in the west part of the zone (near the Arena). Levitate speeds things up a ton by being able to scoot across water 19 12-19 Oasis of Marr Orc Highway Orcs 100% cla 19-21 17-19 Kerra Island ?
